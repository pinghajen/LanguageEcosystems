# LanguageEcosystems
A repository to help you learn the different ecosystems of different programming languages

The point of this repository is to catelogue the ecosystems of different programming languages, NOT to give comprehensive tutorials on the tools. This resource tells you were to look for different tooling, conventions, style guides, best practices, libraries, package managers, and test suites, just to name a few.
